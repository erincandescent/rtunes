Introduction
------------

The rtunes library is designed for MPlayer.  When the library is applied
to the MPlayer build you will be able to stream any codec supported by
MPlayer to the AirPort Express device.  The rtunes library is accessed
over the MPlayer Audio Output module.

As the rtunes Audio Output module is not included in the official MPlayer
build yet, you have to apply it manually when building MPlayer.

Note: mplayer.diff applies correctly to MPlayer-1.0pre8.  If you use
      another version you are on your own.

Installation
------------

Do the following steps to build MPlayer with rtunes support:

	* build rtunes
	* apply mplayer.diff to the MPlayer source directory
	* copy librtunes.a to your system library directory (e.g. /usr/lib)
	* build mplayer

Note: This works also for the OpenBSD port.  Just use the MPlayer source in
      the ports working directory after doing a `make patch`.

Usage
-----

Now MPlayer should include rtunes support.  Check if it worked by:

	mplayer -ao help

To stream audio:

	mplayer -ao rtunes:device=192.168.1.23 <audiofile>

	mplayer -ao rtunes:device=192.168.1.23 <URL>

Have fun!
